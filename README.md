<p>Greetings, fellow carbon-based lifeforms!</p>
<p>I'm <strong>Mark</strong>, and I want to increase my knowledge about programming languages, coding principles, and other stuff.</p>
<p>This repository is an archive (or a dump) of my learning journey, documenting my progress through notes, hands-on exercises, and practice projects. Basically, it contains all the evidence of my struggles and triumphs <em>(mostly struggles, let's be real)</em>.</p>
