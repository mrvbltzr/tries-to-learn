<p>Greetings, fellow carbon-based lifeforms!</p>
<p>I'm <strong>Mark</strong>, and I want to increase my knowledge about programming languages, coding principles, and other stuff.</p>
<p>This repository is an archive (or a dump) of my learning journey, documenting my progress through notes, hands-on exercises, and practice projects. Basically, it contains all the evidence of my struggles and triumphs <em>(mostly struggles, let's be real)</em>.</p>

| **[Code Editor Shortcut](https://github.com/timhor/obsidian-editor-shortcuts)**    | Add keyboard shortcuts commonly found in code editors such as VSCode.                         | I love VSCode. My fingers have muscle memory for `Ctrl + D` and `Ctrl + Shift + K`. Without them, I question my entire existence.                               |
| **[Code Styler](https://github.com/mayurankv/Obsidian-Code-Styler)**               | A plugin for Obsidian.md for styling codeblocks and inline code                               | The stock one is boring. Makes my code blocks go from drab to fab, so my code examples don't look like they were copy-pasted from StackOverflow.                |
| **[Editing Toolbar](https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-editing-toolbar)**          | A toolbar plugin.                                                                             | Used it exactly once to make this table. Worth it.                                                                                                              |
| **[File Color](https://github.com/ecustic/obsidian-file-color)**                   | An Obsidian plugin for setting colors on folders and files in the file tree.                  | Colorize the file tree so that my notes don't mix up with other notes. Because my file system should look like a unicorn exploded, not a dreary filing cabinet. |
| **[File Explorer Note Count](https://github.com/ozntel/file-explorer-note-count)** | Obsidian Plugin for viewing the number of elements under each folder within the file explorer | Helps me see how many notes I have created...or wasted? My therapist says it's a valuable metric either way.                                                    |
| **[Iconize](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize)**                   | Simply add icons to anything you want in Obsidian.                                            | Because why not? My notes deserve to be as visually stimulating as a Renaissance painting, not a dusty scroll.                                                  |
| **[Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter)**                           | Formats and styles your notes with a focus on configurability and extensibility.              | Turns my chaotic digital scribbles into something that _almost_ looks like I have my life together.                                                             |
| **[Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)**                         | Templating language that lets you insert variables and function results into your notes.      | My entire note-taking system depends on this. If it breaks, I quit.                                                                                             |
