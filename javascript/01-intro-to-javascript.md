## ECMAScript

- **ECMA International** is the organization responsible for maintaining standards for various technologies, including the **ECMAScript** specification.

- **ECMAScript** is the **official specification** or reference document that describes how the language should work, rather than being a language we download and use directly.

- When a feature is "added" to JavaScript, it is actually added as **descriptive text** in the **ECMAScript** document, and then browsers must follow those rules to implement it.

> [!info] MARK'S NOTE
>
> - Ang ECMA ay isang organisasyon na responsable sa pag maintain ng standards para sa mga technologies, kasama na dito ang JavaScript.
> 
> - Ang ECMAScript naman ay ang "blueprint" para sundan ng mga browser developers. Hindi sila ang nag-i-implement, kundi sila lamang ang naglalatag ng rules na "dapat ganito". Ang browser developers mismo ang mag-i-implement ng functionality, kaya minsan nagkakaroon ng incompatibility or delay ng implementation sa ibang browsers.

## Versioning and Naming History

- Historically, updates happened in large batches such as `ES5`, while `ES4` was actually cancelled.

- After `ES6` took six years to be released, the committee switched to **annual updates** to make the process more frequent.

- Modern version naming now uses the year of release, meaning `ES2015`, `ES2016`, and `ES2017` are the standard terms, though **ES6** and **ES2015** refer to the same thing.

> [!info] MARK'S NOTE
>
> Ang naming convention nila dati ay ES5, ES6, etc. Ngayon, ang gamit na nila ay year like ES2015, ES2025, etc.

## Browser Compatibility

- Because different browsers implement features at different speeds, not all features are available in every browser at the same time.

- We can use the website **`caniuse.com`** to check the **compatibility chart** for specific features to see which browsers support them.

- Newer features, such as `arrow functions`, might be supported in **Chrome** and **Firefox** but remain completely unsupported in older browsers like **Internet Explorer**.

> [!info] MARK'S NOTE
>
> Tulad ng sinabi ko sa taas, hindi ang ECMA ang nag-i-implement ng functions kundi browser developers. Kaya minsan, mas nauuna si Chrome kaysa kay Firefox or Safari, minsan naman si Firefox.

## MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)

- **MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)** is the most reliable resource available and serves as the near-official documentation for JavaScript.

- Unlike languages such as **Python**, which have a centralized official website, `JavaScript` is an implementation of a script spec across various browsers, making **MDN** the best central **reference**.

- We can access the site at [**developer.mozilla.org**](developer.mozilla.org) to find tutorials, technology guides, and a complete reference for JavaScript.

- This resource is maintained by **Mozilla**, the organization behind the **Firefox** browser.

> [!info] MARK'S NOTE
>
> Walang official documentations ang JavaScript, pero si MDN ang pinaka-close enough para maging docs ni JS.
